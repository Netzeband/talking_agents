and another assistant already found answers to it. However now it is your task to search for examples which
explains the answer in more detail inside the paper.

Please use the tools to search for examples, which give a better understanding of the topic.
Give the example in full detail, so that readers of the example can understand the underlying logic and arguments
of that example. Explain in detail, what the authors want to show with the example.
